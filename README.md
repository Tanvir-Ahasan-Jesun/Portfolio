## About Me

I help Dutch and international SMEs turn messy spreadsheets into **profit-driving insights**.  
I specialize in automating reporting, identifying revenue leaks, and building **decision dashboards** for businesses that do not require a full-time data team.  

I bridge the gap between **technical Python/SQL analysis** and clear **business strategy**, delivering actionable insights that drive growth.
